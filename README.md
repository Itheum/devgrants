# Itheum Grants

Welcome to the Itheum Grant Platform! The Itheum Grant Platform connects grant makers with builders and researchers in the Itheum community. Whether you represent a foundation that wants to move the space forward, a company looking to accelerate development on the features your application needs, or a dev team itching to hack on Itheum tools, you've come to the right place. Take a look at the supported grant types and available opportunities below.

## Grant Types

### Requests for Proposals (RFPs)
RFPs are grants for specific development work. As the name suggests, we are requesting proposals from teams that want to complete the work specified in each RFP. In these grants, we generally have clearly scoped deliverables, milestones, and funding limits. Some RFPs will ask you to propose your own milestones and funding needs. While there is some flexibility in RFP deliverables, we expect teams will deliver what is in scope in the RFP. Any deviations from the specified scope must be approved between your team and ours before we can approve funding. RFPs may be funded by Protocol Labs, other community members, or a consortium of interested parties.
